## Running Tests

To run the automated tests, ensure you are in the root directory of the project.

1.  **Permissions**:
    Make sure the `run.sh` script is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```

2.  **Execution**:
    Run the tests using the main test runner script:
    ```bash
    python run_tests.py
    ```
    The script will discover and run all unit and integration tests located in the `tests/` directory. Test results will be printed to the console.
